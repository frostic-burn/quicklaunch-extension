# quicklaunch-extension
The extension makes it very convenient to save all open tabs into named sessions, which can be relaunched anytime with a single click.

Each session can be renamed, deleted, or reordered with drag-and-drop, you can open single tabs, delete sessions, remove them, or even launch only the selected ones. Everything is stored in chrome.storage.local, making sessions persistent between browser restarts.
